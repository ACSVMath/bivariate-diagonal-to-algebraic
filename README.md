# Algebraic Functions from Bivariate Rational Diagonals

This repository contains code to compute an annihilating polynomial for the diagonal of a bivariate rational function in SageMath, using the method described in [Algebraic diagonals and walks: algorithms, bounds, complexity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717116301250) by Bostan, Dumont, and Salvy (Journal of Symbolic Computation, Volume 83, Pages 68-92, 2017).

This implementation was created by Stephen Melczer and Peiran Tao at the University of Waterloo. It is still undergoing full testing -- feel free to send any comments or bug reports to the authors.
